          <h2 class="testimonial-text">A head for business, a heart for the 
            world" is what defines the Enactus Community. Enactus, at its core, 
            forces you to focus on the problems troubling the world and to 
            find out a sustainable solution for it.
            Enactus MLNC has been a major part of who I am today as a human 
            being. It woke me up to do something for the planet on which my
             entire existence is dependent. I became aware of all the ways 
             we are going wrong and through our projects,
            took little steps to right those wrongs. lnteracting with the 
            community, empowering our benefactors, doing street plays with 
            deep messages to make people aware of our projects and its goals, 
            hustling everyday to make the best of our
            projects is what constituted my time at Enactus MLNC. Enacts MLNC
            has taught me compassion, empathy and considering others before 
            self. All of these are life lessons which will be with me throughout
             my life and I can't thank Enactus
            enough for that.</h2>

          <h2 class="testimonial-text">Enactus at MLNC, for me, was an absolutely colossal experience in
            terms of the sheer highs and lows that we went through as a unit
            throughout college life. It was an experience in the simple art of
            blending complicated aspects of social entrepreneurship, which then
            led me to my inclination towards Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)
            and a general sense of social responsibility, empathy and humility that
            is tied to every action I take individually or as a part of a group. It
            was also the place where I forged the most trusted friendships and found
            the most inspiring people that I know till date; and it's importance
            to me can be gauged by the fact that I still closely follow all the
            activities at Enactus MLNC and try and do my bit whenever the opportunity
            presents itself, despite graduating years ago.</h2>

          <h2 class="testimonial-text">Have I had to tell one word to summon my experience at enactus,
            it would be learning. 
            Learning which comes from a thousand different avenues, in an extremely
            short tenure and makes about a person. It is a majestic view to look back
            at how it started and sail my self through it’s days. Tasks which would
            generally appear struggle-some to anyone have felt elementary simple here
            due to a diligent compliance mechanism and the warm environment that persists
            in the society.Enactus has always been very welcoming to who so ever making it after the
            fine selection process. All the members are even yet unique. The society
            distinguishes the inherent qualities of it’s members and refines them to
            an embellished skillset. A glimpse of my days back then would manifest me,
            dealing with slum women; working upon our welfare project simultaneously maintaining a touch with
            big corporates sponsoring us, leading presentations about our projects in
            front of numerous stakeholders on different occasions, learning tech work
            from my seniors and imparting the same to my juniors , working on decor
            tasks for our periodical fests and most unforgettable, partying with my
            team mates which has always been an inevitable activity here.
            This prestegious society has developed me holistically and given me the most
            glorious days of college. I thereby feel both gloomy and contented to be
            called an alumni of this society.</h2>

          <h2 class="testimonial-text">There is only one word to describe my 2.5 year journey with Enactus -
            EXCEPTIONAL
            Being in Enactus gives you that personal satisfaction that you are doing
            not just for the society but for your own personal development as you
            get to experience so many new things, meet different people, get to
            understand social problems and the list is endless.
            When i started Project Sneh, the research, field visit and having all
            the discussions, it was a completely different time of my life.
            And the best part was interacting with people and getting to know the
            core of Sanitation scenario in Delhi. Many a times, people only talk
            about this online and give their opinion but Enactus gives you the
            oppertunity of implementing the solution that you think can solve
            that problem and that's what we did at Project Sneh after realizing
            how big the issue of infant sanitation is, we came up with Reusable
            Cloth diaper for that which were eco friendly as well as more hygenic.
            All those events, online campaign, Business plan competition ,
            brainstorming sessions has completely changed my mindset which I
            will cherish for the rest of my life.</h2>
