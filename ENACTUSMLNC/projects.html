          <h1>Project Parivartan</h1>
          <p>We started Project Parivartan in the year 2016, 
              as a financial aid to our project, Project DESI.
               Under Project Parivartan, a variety of hand-made dog 
               accessories, including dog collars, leashes and sweaters 
               are manufactured and sold under the brand name - BeDesi. 
               This range of products is paw-friendly and also ensures 
               great quality and better durability. These products are 
               available in attractive colours and all sizes.

            Our manufacturers belong to an underprivileged community in 
            Delhi NCR. The women of this community manufacture our BeDesi 
            products not only with love, but also with due attention and 
            perfection.
            
            A part of the revenue generated from the sale of these products
             goes to our women "Auntrepreneurs", and the other part is 
             utilized to sustain the project. 
            
            While workplace discrimination is still prevalent and deep-rooted 
            in most areas of our country, our project aims at uplifting and 
            empowering these women, and helping them to become self-reliant, 
            and transform into the bread-earners for themselves and their 
            families, and ensure a quality standard of living for them. 
            The women associated with Project Parivartan have been benefitted 
            not only in realizing their abilities, but also in creating an 
            environment where women prove to be an effective human resource.

      <h1>Project DESI</h1>
      <p>India is home to around 30 million stray dogs. 
          These poor little beings are often subjected to abuse 
          and brutal killing by the people due to insensitivity and 
          lack of awareness amongst them. Improper care and negligence
           of our street buddies has lead to a rise in various issues
            such as overpopulation of stray dogs, dog bites, rabies 
            and various other diseases.

        We, at Enactus MLNC, work towards creating a safe and better 
        environment for the stray dogs through our Project DESI. DESI 
        stands for Duty to Empathize, Sterilize and Immunize stray dogs.
        
        Sadism and cruelty by humans, often lead to unjustified killing 
        and scarred lives of this breed. Seeing them as mere nuisance and 
        
        not caring for their well being is costing these poor strays their 
        lives. Enactus MLNC believes that street dogs deserve as much love 
        and care as any other living being. Hence ‘Duty to Empathize’. 
        Sterilization and Immunization are the most humane and potent ways to control their rising population, and spreading of diseases through them. Hence ‘Duty to Sterilize and Immunize’.
        

        The team of Project DESI has collaborated with various Animal
         Welfare NGOs including Friendicoes, Paws and SSGACC, and has 
         conducted sterilization and immunization drives in various parts 
         of Delhi NCR.
        
        Through the DESI model, we intend to make people aware of their 
        misery and make them understand that affection and compassion for 
        these fellow beings are the foundation of a better world, besides 
        being the first steps to make peaceful co-existence possible.
